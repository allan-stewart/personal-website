<p>
    I love writing code.
    Over the years as I have learned to do it professionally, I have found that I am as interested in the
    methodologies and practices around software development as I am about actually writing code.
    I am an advocate for Agile and Lean methods combined with practices such as test driven development,
    continuous integration, and continuous delivery.
</p>

<p>
    I currently work at <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> as the tech lead on a team
    practicing <a href="http://mobprogramming.org/">mob programming</a> daily.
    I am a regular attendee of the <a href="http://utahsc.org/">Utah Software Craftsmanship</a> group
    and I speak at local conferences and meetups.
