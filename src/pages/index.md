I love writing code.
Over the years as I have learned to do it professionally, I have found that I am as interested in the
methodologies and practices around software development as I am about actually writing code.
I am an advocate for Agile and Lean methods combined with practices such as test driven development,
continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

I currently work at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) as the tech lead on a team
practicing [mob programming](http://mobprogramming.org) daily.
I am a regular attendee of the [Utah Software Craftsmanship](http://utahsc.org/) group
and I speak at local conferences and meetups.

## Influences
Although I have read many good books, the following ones have had the most impact on how I think about software development:

* _Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin
* _The Clean Coder_ by Robert C. Martin
* _This Is Lean: Resolving the Efficiency Paradox_ by Niklas Modig &amp; Pär Åhlström
* _The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride_ by Sandro Mancuso
* _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable_ by Patrick Lencioni
