I love writing code.
Over the years as I have learned to do it professionally, I have found that I am as interested in the
methodologies and practices around software development as I am about actually writing code.
I am an advocate for Agile and Lean methods combined with practices such as test driven development,
continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

I currently work at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) as the tech lead on a team
practicing [mob programming](http://mobprogramming.org) daily.
I am a regular attendee of the [Utah Software Craftsmanship](http://utahsc.org/) group
and I speak at local conferences and meetups.


## Influences
I was interested in computers and code from a young age.
The catalyst for me getting into a software development career was working on simulator
controls in HyperCard for the Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center.
This led me to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

After graduation from college, I found that I still had a lot to learn to be an effective professional.
I wanted to write software _well_ rather than just get a job done,
so learning about better ways to write software became important to me.
On the job experiences (both positive and negative) taught be much,
but lacking a strong mentor I relied on the Internet and books.
The following books have had the most impact on how I think about software development:

* _Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin
* _The Clean Coder_ by Robert C. Martin
* _This Is Lean: Resolving the Efficiency Paradox_ by Niklas Modig &amp; Pär Åhlström
* _The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride_ by Sandro Mancuso
* _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable_ by Patrick Lencioni

I believe that we need more professionalism in our industry.
Individuals need to choose that path and demonstrate the value to businesses.
When applied collaboratively in teams, the professional's practices make those teams more effective.
And once we've found practices that work, we need to share them with others.
