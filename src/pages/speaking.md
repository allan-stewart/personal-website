# Speaking
I enjoy speaking on topics about software development.
I have presented at a number of conferences, both public and within the companies I have worked for.


## Topics

Here are some of the topics I am currently speaking on:

### Mob Programming
Mob programming is described by Woody Zuill as "all the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer."
In this talk, I discuss my experiences with teams that practice mob programming daily, including fully remote teams.
I cover what mob programming is, the principles that make it effective, and many of the benefits it provides.

A version of this talk was recorded at a virtual meeting of the [SLC.NET User Group](https://slcnet.tech/):

### Your Architecture is Coupled to Your Culture
Can the culture of your company negatively impact your software architecture?
Should your desired software architecture lead to changing how teams are structured in your organization?
In this talk I will discuss how this hidden coupling affects software projects and give some specific examples of how Pluralsight leveraged it.

### Software Craftsmanship
There is a growing movement within the software industry that calls for people who write code to act and be treated more professionally.
Software craftsmanship is a way to do so.
This presentation covers aspects of craftsmanship and why both developers and employers should want it practiced.
