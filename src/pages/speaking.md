# Speaking
I enjoy speaking on topics about software development.
I have presented at a number of conferences, both public and within the companies I have worked for.


## Topics

Here are some of the topics I am currently speaking on:

### 2.5 Years of Mob Programming
Mob programming is described by Woody Zuill as "all the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer."
In this talk, I discuss my experiences on a team that practiced mob programming daily.
I cover what mob programming is and many of the benefits it provides.

### Levels of Abstraction and the Single Responsibility Principle
Writing code is inherently an exercise in abstraction.
How can a better understanding of abstractions help us follow the single responsibility principle and write better code?
Can these concepts be applied outside of code at the library or service level?

### Software Craftsmanship
There is a growing movement within the software industry that calls for people who write code to act and be treated more professionally.
Software craftsmanship is a way to do so.
This presentation covers aspects of craftsmanship and why both developers and employers should want it practiced.
